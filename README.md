FAED stands for financial aid eligibility detector. This language at his core is created with hopes 
of making the process of verifying a student’s eligibility for financial aid as simple as possible.
We want all the calculations, all the decisions, all the implications to be handled by the simples 
of command, a macro. The system is flexible, meaning it can be modified and customized to handle 
different schools criteria; it can be expanded adding new requirements, and options. The design 
is maid to be used by anyone, no knowledge in computing nor mathematics is required; all you’ll 
need is the student’s name and his grades. From that you can learn his GPA, his status, meaning if 
he’s eligible or not, and if he is how much he’s getting and you also have the power if the student 
fails short to still consider his case if he satisfies other requirements. We understand this kind 
of work often take days, sometime even week, but this is where our language comes in. 
We will be using PLY to implement our language, the python parser and scanner tool that will allow 
us to make the language as easy straight forward as possible.
